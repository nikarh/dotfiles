# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Default authentication and topic access control
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Control access to the broker using a password file. This file can be
# generated using the mosquitto_passwd utility. If TLS support is not compiled
# into mosquitto (it is recommended that TLS support should be included) then
# plain text passwords are used, in which case the file should be a text file
# with lines in the format:
# username:password
# The password (and colon) may be omitted if desired, although this 
# offers very little in the way of security.
# 
# See the TLS client require_certificate and use_identity_as_username options
# for alternative authentication options.

# Access may also be controlled using a pre-shared-key file. This requires
# TLS-PSK support and a listener configured to use it. The file should be text
# lines in the format:
# identity:key
# The key should be in hexadecimal format without a leading "0x".
#psk_file

# Control access to topics on the broker using an access control list
# file. If this parameter is defined then only the topics listed will
# have access.
# If the first character of a line of the ACL file is a # it is treated as a
# comment.
# Topic access is added with lines of the format:
#
# topic [read|write] <topic>
# 
# The access type is controlled using "read" or "write". This parameter
# is optional - if not given then the access is read/write.
# <topic> can contain the + or # wildcards as in subscriptions.
# 
# The first set of topics are applied to anonymous clients, assuming
# allow_anonymous is true. User specific topic ACLs are added after a 
# user line as follows:
#
# user <username>
#
# The username referred to here is the same as in password_file. It is
# not the clientid.
#
#
# If is also possible to define ACLs based on pattern substitution within the
# topic. The patterns available for substition are:
#
# %c to match the client id of the client
# %u to match the username of the client
#
# The substitution pattern must be the only text for that level of hierarchy.
#
# The form is the same as for the topic keyword, but using pattern as the
# keyword.
# Pattern ACLs apply to all users even if the "user" keyword has previously
# been given.
#
# If using bridges with usernames and ACLs, connection messages can be allowed
# with the following pattern:
# pattern write $SYS/broker/connection/%c/state
#
# pattern [read|write] <topic>
#
# Example:
#
# pattern write sensor/%u/data
#
